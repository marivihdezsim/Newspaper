            <h2>Historic Flooding from Huricane Helene hits Asheville, NC. </h2>
            <p>Western North Carolina is reeling from severe flooding following the arrival of Hurricane Helene, which made landfall over the weekend. The storm brought torrential rain and high winds, causing rivers to overflow and leading to widespread damage across the region. </p> 

            <p> Authorities reported over 10 inches of rain in some areas, resulting in flash floods that affected numerous communities. Emergency services were deployed to assist with rescues and evacuations, particularly in low-lying neighborhoods and those near swollen rivers. Residents were urged to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary, as many roads became impassable due to rising waters and debris.</p>
                
            <p> “Safety is our top priority,” said Emergency Management Director, Sarah Jennings. “We’re working tirelessly to ensure everyone is safe and accounted for. We encourage residents to heed evacuation orders and stay informed through local alerts.” </p>
                
            <p>The flooding has caused significant disruptions, with schools and businesses closing in affected areas. Power outages have also been reported, leaving thousands without electricity as utility crews work to restore services.</p>
                
            <p>In downtown Asheville, several streets were flooded, and some businesses sustained water damage. Local officials are assessing the overall impact and planning for recovery efforts, with a focus on providing support to those who lost homes or faced significant property damage.</p>
                
            <p>The National Weather Service has issued warnings for continued rain in the area, prompting concerns of further flooding. “Residents should remain vigilant and prepare for potential additional rainfall,” said meteorologist James Taylor. “Conditions are still unstable, and we advise caution.”</p>
                
            <p>Local shelters have been set up to accommodate displaced residents, offering food, supplies, and a safe haven during this challenging time. Community organizations are mobilizing to provide assistance, and donations of food and supplies are being accepted.</p>
                
            <p>As recovery efforts begin, officials are emphasizing the importance of preparedness in the face of future storms. “This serves as a reminder of the power of nature and the need for our communities to be prepared,” said Jennings. “We will rebuild and support one another through this.” </p>
                
            <p>Residents are encouraged to stay updated through local news channels and the emergency management website for the latest information and resources.</p>
